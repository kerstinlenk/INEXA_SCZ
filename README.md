# INEXA_SCZ

## Folder Structure
* *inexa*: Python Code for executing the INEXA model. To execute the code, simply execute the file *main.py* from inside the *inexa* folder. You need to have the libraries numpy and pandas installed. 
* *networks*: Folder containing different network topologies, saved as CSV. Inside *networks*, you'll find three folders, *network_0*, *network_1* and *network_2*. All networks inside one *network_x* folder have the same  neuron/astrocyte locations.
* *statistics*: R Code for executing the statistical analysis.
